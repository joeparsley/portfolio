        <p id="about">Hey There! As you can tell, my name is <strong>Joe Parsley!</strong> Currently, I'm a student at Epicodus but have kind of been all over carrer wise! Right out of highschool I started school at Mount Hood Community College. I changed my focus while in school probably once every two terms but evenetually I found my way into computer languages. I studied Databasing and cyber security and really enjoyed tinkering with anything that was given to me. I eventually had to take a break from school and started working full time in food service. After a couple years of that I was able to land a management postion at a Local company and stayed there for 3 years. I've since then, have left that job in pursit of something better and you're reading the results!</p>
